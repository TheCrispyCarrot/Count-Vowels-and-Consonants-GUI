# Count-Vowels-and-Consonants-GUI

This is a small java project that creates a GUI to count vowels, connsonants, or letters in 
an entered string. The user can enter a string into a text box and then select a desired button 
of which type of letter they would like to count, and the program counts the selected letters.
